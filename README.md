### Installation

#### Windows

Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages.

PyBox2D contains portable C++ code which needs to be bound to Python somehow.
On Windows Visual Studio is needed for that.

More info maybe at: [pybox2d installation guide](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

#### Linux

Make sure "swig" is installed on your system to handle the c++ components in the PyBox2D library.

Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages.
