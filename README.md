### Installation

Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages.

PyBox2D contains portable C++ code which needs to be bound to Python somehow.  
Not sure that works on Linux. On Windows Visual Studio is needed for that.  

More info maybe at: [pybox2d instllation guide](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

### Useful Links

The [pybox2d Manual](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d/wiki/manual) was very useful to understand the concepts of Box2D
